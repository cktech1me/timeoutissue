When using Suite Files and suite File paths the testng-failed.xml 
created on the /reports/testng-failed.xml level is duplicate (and perhaps should contain ALL tests that failed?)

When setting the suite level timeout (which is less than the timeout on thread.sleep in timeoutTests.java, 
sometimes the test "FAILS" and reports the failure, other times it does NOT.
